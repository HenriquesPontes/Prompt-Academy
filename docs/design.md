# Skribe Design System

## Color Tokens

```yaml
paper: "#0a2947" # Blueprint Navy base background
ink: "#ffffff" # White text for contrast against navy
ink-soft: "#a0b5c9" # Lighter blue/grey for secondary text
chrome-bg: "#071b30" # Darker ink for recessed panels and spec sheets
chrome-text: "#ffffff"
chrome-text-soft: "#8ba1b6"
hairline: "rgba(255,255,255,0.15)" # Faint white for dashed lines/borders
accent: "#f2a93b" # Amber for interactive/active elements
accent-deep-green: "#e09825"
accent-warm: "#f2a93b"
selection: "rgba(242, 169, 59, 0.2)"
highlight: "#123759"
success: "#6fd6a8" # Mint green for approved/correct states
warning: "#f2a93b"
error: "#ef6f5c" # Coral for wrong/error states
```

The app completely inverts typical "light mode" aesthetics. The base is `paper` (Blueprint Navy), covered by a faint white grid (`.blueprint-grid` in `globals.css`). 
`chrome-bg` is used for panels that act as "spec sheets" or "drafts". 

Color carries meaning, not decoration. `accent` (Amber) is used for any interactive elements, hovering, or unlocked states. `success` (Mint Green) is used exclusively for "APPROVED" or "CORRECT" states, while `error` (Coral) is reserved for invalid inputs or mistakes.

`hairline` is heavily utilized alongside `border-dashed` to create measurement lines, spec boundaries, and cut-outs.

## Typography

```yaml
font-sans: "var(--font-inter), sans-serif"
font-serif: "var(--font-space-grotesk), sans-serif"
font-mono: "IBM Plex Mono, JetBrains Mono, monospace"

text-xs: 0.75rem
text-sm: 0.875rem
text-base: 1rem
text-doc: 1.125rem
text-doc-h3: 1.375rem
text-doc-h2: 1.625rem
text-doc-h1: 2.125rem
text-display: 3rem
```

- **Inter (`font-sans`)**: Body copy. Stays out of the way, clean and readable.
- **Space Grotesk (`font-serif`)**: Headings and titles. Provides a geometric, slightly technical drafted feel.
- **IBM Plex Mono (`font-mono`)**: Used extensively for code, prompt text, labels, revision tags (e.g., `REV 01`), and anything that represents "the actual prompt".

The global body enables `kern`, `liga`, and `onum`. Letter spacing is normally `0`. Small uppercase labels may add positive tracking (`tracking-widest`) when needed, especially in revision tags or rubber stamps.

## Spacing, Radius, Motion

```yaml
space-0-5: 0.125rem
space-1: 0.25rem
space-2: 0.5rem
space-3: 0.75rem
space-4: 1rem
space-5: 1.25rem
space-6: 1.5rem
space-8: 2rem
space-10: 2.5rem
space-12: 3rem
space-16: 4rem
space-20: 5rem
space-24: 6rem

radius-sm: 4px
radius: 6px
radius-md: 6px
radius-lg: 8px
radius-pill: 999px

shadow-modal: "0 4px 24px rgb(42 42 42 / 8%)"
transition: "150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)"
```

Most permanent chrome uses 0-8px radii and 1px hairlines. The explicit pill exception is the AI composer family: collapsed AI launcher, expanded prompt surface, icon buttons, selected-text chips, toggles, and submit/cancel circles.

The app uses transitions sparingly. Sidebar width and opacity animate over 200ms. AI prompt expansion animates width/max-width over 200ms. Stream preview dismisses with transform/opacity over 220ms. Global reduced-motion support forces animations and transitions down to 1ms.

## Layout

Skribe has two primary modes:

- Empty state: centered paper surface with logo, `Skribe` display wordmark, tagline, primary open-folder action, and recent folders.
- Project state: optional preflight banner, left file navigation, central editor, floating AI composer, settings/project-instructions modals.

The app root is `paper` with `ink` text. The sidebar is `chrome-bg`, bordered on the right with a 1px `hairline`, and resizes between 200px and 360px with a 240px default. It can collapse to 0px while keeping floating top controls available.

The editor column sits on `paper`. The ProseMirror document is centered at `max-width: 44rem`, uses `px-8`, `pt-16`, and `pb-40` so content stays clear of the floating AI composer. The toolbar is sticky at the top, also constrained to 44rem internally.

The AI composer is absolutely positioned at `bottom: 2rem`, centered, and capped at 44rem. It collapses to a 48px logo button and expands into a white rounded composer.

The status line is no longer a bottom strip. It is a zero-height sticky overlay below the toolbar, with document stats and save status aligned to the upper-right of the editor viewport.

## Elevation And Depth

Skribe is mostly flat, but not completely flat anymore.

Flat surfaces:

- App background and editor document.
- Sidebar and preflight banner.
- Editor toolbar.
- Settings tab panels.
- Permanent text and file tree regions.

Lifted surfaces:

- Modals and confirmation dialogs use `shadow-modal`.
- File and folder context menus use paper, hairline border, 6px radius, and `shadow-modal`.
- Clarification popup uses paper, 8px radius, arrow, and `shadow-modal`.
- The AI composer uses a stronger custom shadow: `0 10px 30px rgb(42 42 42 / 12%)`.
- The AI mention menu uses `0 16px 40px rgb(42 42 42 / 16%)`.
- File preview thumbnails use a small resting shadow: `0 1px 2px rgb(42 42 42 / 8%)`.
- The stream preview uses translucent white, `shadow-modal`, and `backdrop-blur-xl`.

Do not add new shadows to large permanent page regions. Shadows should identify a floating control, a transient menu, the AI composer, or a tiny document thumbnail.

## Components

### App Shell

The shell is a full-height flex column on `paper`. The optional preflight banner is `min-height: 3rem`, `chrome-bg`, `chrome-text`, with a bottom hairline and compact link buttons. Top chrome controls use Phosphor icons inside 32px transparent buttons with `chrome-text-soft` resting color and `ink` hover color.

The sidebar reserves a 48px top row for drag space and create actions. Icon controls do not use filled backgrounds in the resting state.

### Empty State

The empty state is centered on `paper` with a 480px max width. It shows `/logo.png` at 9rem tall, then the `Skribe` wordmark in `text-display`, Plex Serif, medium weight, zero tracking, and `ink`. The tagline is `text-base` in `chrome-text-soft`. Recent folders render as small text rows with `rounded-sm`, `px-2`, `py-2`, and `chrome-bg` hover.

### Buttons

Base button:

- `inline-flex`, 36px height, centered content, 8px gap.
- 6px radius.
- `px-4`, `text-sm`, medium weight.
- Disabled controls drop to 40% opacity and disable pointer events.

Variants:

- Primary: `accent` background, `paper` text, hover `#162132`.
- Secondary: transparent background, `px-3`, `chrome-text`, hover `paper/50`.
- Link: auto height, no radius, no horizontal padding, `accent` text, underline on hover.
- Danger: `error` background, `paper` text, slight brightness reduction on hover.

Special icon buttons in the shell override secondary styling to be 32px square, transparent, borderless, shadowless, and icon-only.

### Inputs, Selects, Textareas

Inputs are 36px tall, full width by default, 6px radius, 1px `hairline` border, `paper` background, `ink` text, and `chrome-text-soft` placeholder. Focus changes the border to `accent` with no glow. Selects match the same border, radius, and paper fill, using `text-sm`. Textareas in settings and project instructions use the same visual language with relaxed line height.

### Modals

The modal backdrop is `#2A2A2A66` with `backdrop-blur-[2px]` and 24px viewport padding. Default modal panels are `paper`, `ink`, 8px radius, 24px padding, `shadow-modal`, and 480px max width. Settings increases to 560px; delete confirmation reduces to 360px.

Modal titles use `text-doc-h3`, semibold, tight leading. The close control is an icon-only secondary button.

### Tooltips

Tooltips appear after 500ms hover. They use `accent` background, `paper` text, `text-xs`, 4px radius, `px-3`, `py-2`, `shadow-modal`, and nowrap layout. They currently support top and bottom placement.

### Toggles

Toggles are full-width rows with `py-2`, `text-sm`, and `ink` text. The switch is 44px by 24px, pill-shaped, with a 1px hairline border. Checked state fills with `accent`; unchecked state fills with `chrome-bg`. The knob is 16px, pill-shaped, and `paper`.

### Settings

Settings lives inside the modal system. Tabs are a four-column tablist with a bottom hairline. Active tabs use a 2px `accent` bottom border, semibold `ink`, and near-full opacity. Inactive tabs use `chrome-text`, medium weight, 65% opacity, and hover toward `ink`.

Panels are not carded. They occupy the same grid cell and hide inactive panels with `invisible` and disabled pointer events. The Claude Code status panel is the one intentionally framed section: `chrome-bg`, hairline border, 6px radius, 12px padding.

### File Tree

The file tree is virtualized and scrolls inside the sidebar with `px-2` and `py-2`.

Folder rows:

- 36px row height.
- 32px internal button.
- `text-xs`, semibold, `chrome-text-soft`.
- Hover uses `highlight` and `chrome-text`.
- Expanded folders shift text to `chrome-text`.
- File counts render in tiny paper pills with hairline borders.

File rows:

- 64px height.
- `rounded-sm`, `px-2`, `py-2`, `text-sm`.
- Hover uses `highlight`.
- Active state uses `highlight`, `accent` title text, and `accent/75` folder label.
- Unsaved state is a 6px `accent-warm` dot at the lower-right.
- Actions menu is hidden until hover and opens as a paper popover with hairline border, 6px radius, and `shadow-modal`.

Each file row includes a 40px by 48px document preview thumbnail. The thumbnail uses `paper`, a hairline or `accent/30` border, 2px radius, and a small document-like shadow. While AI is running on that file, the thumbnail becomes an accent spinner.

### Editor

The editor scroll container owns the user-configurable font size and line height. ProseMirror itself is centered, maxed at 44rem, and uses `font-editor`, `text-doc`, and `ink`.

Editor text rules:

- Paragraphs: no top margin, `space-6` bottom margin.
- Headings: `space-12` top margin, `space-4` bottom margin, `ink`, zero letter spacing.
- H1: `text-doc-h1`, 1.25 line height.
- H2: `text-doc-h2`, 1.3 line height.
- H3: `text-doc-h3`, 1.35 line height.
- Lists: `space-6` left padding and bottom margin.
- Blockquotes: 1px `hairline` left border, `ink-soft`, `space-8` vertical margin, `space-4` left padding.
- Inline code: `highlight` background, 4px radius, Plex Mono, `0.9em`, compact horizontal padding.
- Code blocks: `chrome-bg`, hairline border, 8px radius, Plex Mono, 0.9375rem, 1.6 line height, `space-4` padding.
- Links: `accent`, underline, 0.15em underline offset.
- Empty placeholder: `chrome-text-soft`.

The formatting toolbar is sticky at the top on `paper` with a bottom hairline. Its controls are text buttons, `text-base`, `chrome-text-soft`, 32px tall, 4px radius, and spaced with a 20px gap. Active controls become semibold `ink`. Disabled controls drop to 40% opacity.

### Status Overlay

The status overlay appears only when enabled in settings. It is sticky below the toolbar (`top: 57px`) with zero layout height. The actual text block is absolutely positioned at the upper-right with `text-xs`, normal leading, `chrome-text-soft`, right alignment, and pointer events disabled. It can show word count plus reading time, character count, reading level, and save status.

### AI Composer

The AI composer is the most tactile part of the app.

Collapsed state:

- 48px circular logo button.
- White background, hairline border, 12% large shadow.
- 8px padding.
- Slight scale on hover.

Expanded state:

- Centered, `max-width: 44rem`, minimum height 48px.
- White background, 24px pill radius, 1px ring.
- Ring is `hairline` at rest and `accent` while dragging files over it.
- 4px padding with 48px reserved on the right for submit/cancel.
- Large 12% shadow.
- Wraps controls when content, chips, or attachments need more space.

Controls:

- Attach button is a 40px circular icon button.
- Prompt editor is a contenteditable region with `text-base`, normal leading, `ink`, and `chrome-text-soft` empty state.
- Submit is a 40px black circular button with white paper-plane icon; hover is `#1F1F1F`.
- Streaming cancel is a 40px circular secondary button on `paper/50`.
- Error messages sit below the composer in `text-xs` `error`, with link buttons for recovery actions.

Chips:

- Selected text chip: 32px high, pill, `selection` background, `success` text.
- Attachment chip: 36px high, 6px radius, `highlight` background, semibold `ink`, thumbnail or file icon, small metadata in `ink-soft`.
- Document reference chip: 24px high, 6px radius, `#E8F3FF` background, `#1F5D88` text.
- Mention menu: white, 8px radius, hairline border, 16% large shadow; active option uses the same pale blue reference color.

### AI Stream Preview

The stream preview sits directly above the composer. It is capped at 34rem wide and 11rem tall, uses translucent white (`white/75`), `backdrop-blur-xl`, a top-only 8px radius, hairline border with no bottom border, 12px padding, and `shadow-modal`. While waiting for content, it type-animates status words and shows an accent caret. During streaming, it shows an accent spinner. Once complete, it exposes a circular dismiss button.

### Clarification Popup

Clarification prompts float above the composer. The popup is `paper`, `ink`, 8px radius, 16px padding, `shadow-modal`, max width 400px or viewport minus 48px, and includes a small rotated-paper arrow. Options are full-width rows with 6px radius, hairline border, and hover states that move toward `accent` and `chrome-bg`.

## Accessibility

Use semantic roles already present in the app: tree/treeitem for file navigation, toolbar for editor formatting, tablist/tab/tabpanel for settings, dialog for modals, switch for toggles, status/live regions for AI stream preview and save/status feedback.

Global `:focus-visible` is a 2px `accent` outline with 2px offset. Some AI controls use Tailwind focus rings instead; keep them visibly equivalent. Do not remove visible focus states.

Every icon-only button must keep an `aria-label`. Text must fit inside compact controls at every supported editor font size and common desktop window width.

## Do And Don't

Do keep the document column as the quiet center of gravity.

Do use `paper`, `ink`, `chrome-bg`, `hairline`, `highlight`, and `accent` tokens instead of ad hoc colors for normal app UI.

Do treat the white, pill-shaped, shadowed AI composer as a deliberate product signature.

Do keep file rows generous enough for previews: 64px for documents, 36px for folders.

Do use Phosphor icons for chrome and action buttons.

Do preserve the 44rem editor/composer measure and the editor bottom padding that keeps prose clear of the floating composer.

Don't describe or rebuild the AI bar as a full-width bottom strip; that is obsolete.

Don't reintroduce the unused block-context toolbar or inline annotation popover as if they already exist.

Don't make the status line a 24px chrome strip; it is currently a floating stats overlay.

Don't add broad new white surfaces outside the AI composer family without making a deliberate token/design decision.

Don't expand the pale blue reference-chip colors into general app accents.

Don't use negative letter spacing or heavy decorative gradients. The product should still feel editorial, even where the AI composer is more tactile.
